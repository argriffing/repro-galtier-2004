 * Large subunit ribosomal dna
[alignment](http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/datasets/gcanc/lsu_align.html).
This is an html file with asterisks indicating 'good' alignment columns.

 * nhml (Non-Homogeneous Maximum Likelihood?) source code
`ftp://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/pub/mol_phylogeny/nhml`
for 'maximum likelihood phylogenetic inferences from DNA
sequence data using a non-homogeneous Markov model of DNA sequence evolution.'
Because the link is to an ftp server it doesn't play well with
the github security filters.
